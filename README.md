# map-editor
Map Editor game with some similarities with Paint 

In this program you can navigate throught the board and, if you want, pressing "space" key you can make cells painted or, if already painted, unpainted. 
Feature which I'm working on it at this moment: if you need or want to stop the game, you can press "s" key and save the board exactly as it is and, once you run the program again, you can continue from the point you had stopped!
